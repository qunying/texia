TeXiA - TeX in Ada

This project is mainly for learning the internal working of TeX typesetting
system and also programming in Ada.

It has been in my mind for years, but only now has some slow progress.  Not
sure when it will be finished.

-- It is based on TeX version 3.1415926 With help from commonTeX, yytex and
-- texlive web2c code
--
-- Reference book: TeX: The Program (Computers and Typesetting, Volume B),
-- by Donald E. Knuth, Addison - Wesley, millennium edition, 2000,
-- ISBN 0-201-13437-3.
